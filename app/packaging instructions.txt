Installing from 'skeleton' DesktopDeployR clone

* Install R-Portable into ./dist (resulting directory will be ./dist/R-Portable)

* Start R-Portable

** set the current directory to the base-directory (which has ./app and ./dist directories)
   e.g. 'setwd("../../")'

** source the ./dist/script/R/run.R script. 
   This will install packages described in ./app/packages.txt
   It tries to start DailyMeasure, but this package isn't installed yet...
   
** install the devtools packages
   install.packages("devtools")

** copy 'renv.lock' from DailyMeasure repository to the 'current/base' directory
** 'renv::restore()' - this will restore required packages *except* DailyMeasure
   - it happens to copy the required packages to app/library (which is not the typical 'renv' default)
   - probably looks for the first entry in .libPaths()
   - *don't* renv::activate()
     - make sure there is no .Rprofile which tries to active 'renv'

** source the ./app/packagesCustom.R
   This will install the DailyMeasure package

DailyMeasure.bat will start the application

The .iss file for Innosetup is in the base directory

================

if necessary use
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "xyz") to increase number of required Github downloads
