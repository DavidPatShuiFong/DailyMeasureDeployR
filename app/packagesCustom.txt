Custom packages need to be installed manually. The recommended method is to use devtools:

$ Rscript -e "devtools::install('path/to/package', lib = '<appname>/app/library')"

That didn't work for me! Instead something like:

library(devtools)
library(withr)

withr::with_libpaths(new = "c:/Users/vkeli/OneDrive - The University of Melbourne/Rprojects/DailyMeasureDeployR/app/library",
                     install_github("https://github.com/DavidPatShuiFong/shinycssloaders"))

(prefixing with_libpaths with withr:: avoids having to load the withr library, and complaints that 'withr'
is already loaded prior to install!)
					 
shinycssloaders - loading animations
 custom version based on Gao Zheng's 'transparent' background version
 installed with devtools::install_github('DavidPatShuiFong/shinycssloaders')

DTedit - datatable edit wrapper.
 substantially based on jbryer/DTedit
 install with devtools::install_github('DavidPatShuiFong/DTedit')
 
DailyMeasure - the actual app
 install with devtools::install_github('https://github.com/DavidPatShuiFong/DailyMeasure/tree/release/0.2.1')
